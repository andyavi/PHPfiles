PHPfiles
========

Files used to take data from DHCP server log files and add them to a MySQL database through XAMPP

*Peruse at your own discretion*

Keep in mind that all of the PHP in use here is dependent upon the MySQL instance that I have set up, which is under XAMPP. For each of the tables that I am using to store data, they have 7 columns *(as you might surmise from reading the source)*, which store the 7 key elements of DHCP (I know, not all, but it's all that is needed).
